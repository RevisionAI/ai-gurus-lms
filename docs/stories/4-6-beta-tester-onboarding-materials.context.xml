  <notes>
    <note type="audience">
      Beta testers are SME executives - materials must be professional, concise, and respectful of their time.
      Avoid technical jargon, focus on business value and user experience.
    </note>
    <note type="scope">
      This story is documentation and content creation - no code changes required.
      All materials should reference existing production features from Epics 1-3.
    </note>
    <note type="timeline">
      Complete before Story 4.7 (Production Launch) to allow stakeholder review and approval.
      Video recording may take longest - prioritize script creation early.
    </note>
    <note type="support">
      Ensure support contact information is finalized before distributing materials.
      Coordinate with stakeholder on response time commitments.
